So far, our tools are limited and we must restrict ourselves to a simplified model. But nevertheless, this gives us the opportunity to look at the different parts of the training process in more detail and builds up a good base for when we turn to more complicated model architectures in the next exercises.\n",

If you have difficulties, then first try to understand the forward and backward pass with a single input consisting of $D+1$ features. In that case our data matrix has the dimension $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times (D+1)}$. After you have understood this situation, you can go back to the setting where our data matrix has dimension $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times (D+1)}$ and consists of $N$ samples each having $D+1$ features.\n",

    "## 4. Optimizer and Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have successfully dealt with the loss function, which is a method of measuring how well our model fits the given data. The idea of the training process is to iteratively adjust the weights of our model in order to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is where the optimizer comes steps in. During each training step, the optimizer updates the weights of the model w.r.t. the output of the loss function, thereby linking the loss function and model parameters together. The goal is to obtain a model which is accurately predicting the class for a new sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any discussion about optimizers needs to begin with the most popular one, and it's called Gradient Descent. This algorithm is used across all types of Machine Learning (and other math problems) to optimize. It's fast, robust, and flexible. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Initialize the weights with random values.\n",
    "1. Run the forward pass and calculate the loss with the current weights and the loss function.\n",
    "2. Calculate the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. the weights.\n",
    "3. Update weights with the corresponding gradient.\n",
    "4. Iteratively perform Step 1 to 3 until converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the optimizer already hints at the required concept: We use gradients which are very useful for minimizing a function. The gradient of the loss function w.r.t to the weights $w$ of our model tells us how to change our weights $w$ in order to minimize our loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are updated each step as follows:\n",
    "$$ w_{(n+1)} = w_{(n)} - \\alpha \\cdot \\frac {dL}{dw_{(n)}}, $$\n",
    "where $ \\frac {dL}{dw_{(n)}}$ is the gradient of your loss function w.r.t. the weights $w$ at the $n$-th optimization step and $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, which is a predefined positive scalar (usually $ 0 < \\alpha < 1 $) determining the size of the step."
